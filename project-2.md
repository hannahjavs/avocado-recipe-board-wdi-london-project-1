# Project #2: A Full-stack Application

### Overview

The second project is to **build a full-stack RESTful application** that includes **authentication**.

You'll be **building an Express application** that has a **Mongo** database using the **Mongoose ORM**.

Remember to keep things simple and focus on mastering the fundamentals of REST and CRUD – this mini-project is all about making sure you have a good grasp on these key concepts before we move on to the next module.

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 3 models** – one representing a user and two others such as blog posts and comments, or restaurants and reviews.
* **Incude relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
* **The app should include authentication** - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
* **Use a CSS framework** - such as Bootstrap or Bulma to create a grid layout for your app. Additionally you should use custom styling to give your app it's own unique look, such as chaning the font and brand colours.
* **You must use SASS** - as this is a key industry skill.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application** - hosted somewhere on the internet.
* A **link to your hosted working app** - in the URL section of your Github repo.
* A **git repository hosted on Github** - with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A `readme.md` file** - with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Understanding__: Have you demonstrated a sufficient level of understanding of the code that you have submitted? Are you able to talk confidently about the concepts that were covered in this module?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete_
    **1** | _Below expectations_
    **2** | _Meets expectations_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations_

You will also receive written feedback that will include any suggestions on how your project could be improved after the course.
